/**
 * This file demonstrates how to make use of the plugin un/install hooks and creates example entries in the KV Storage
 * 
 * All plugins are in the crisp\core\Plugin context, feel free to use all $this methods, as it's easier to manage than crisp\core\Plugins with all variables set
 * 
 * Please note that the preferred method is to create an onInstall event in the plugin.json as it automatically creates all Keys during the installation
 * thats why the methods have been commented out.
